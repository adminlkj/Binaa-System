Task: Implement a general journal entry reversal system in the Binaa ERP project

Work Log:

**1. Added `reverseEntry()` function to `/src/lib/accounting/engine.ts`:**
- Inserted after `initializeChartOfAccounts()` (before `createJournalEntry`) at line ~371
- Function signature: `reverseEntry(journalEntryId: string, tx: PrismaTransaction)` — tx is REQUIRED (no fallback to db)
- Validation checks:
  - Entry must exist (throws Arabic error if not found)
  - Entry must be POSTED status (throws if DRAFT or CANCELLED)
  - Entry must not already be a reversal (`isReversal = false`)
  - Entry must not already have been reversed (checks for existing entry with `reversedEntryId = originalEntryId`)
- Creates a new reversal entry with:
  - Same date as original
  - Description prefixed with "عكس - "
  - `status: 'POSTED'`
  - Same `sourceType` and `sourceId` as original
  - `isReversal: true`
  - `reversedEntryId` pointing to original entry
  - `isSystem: true`
  - Lines with flipped debit/credit (each line's description prefixed with "عكس - ")
- Updates the original entry `status` to `CANCELLED`
- Returns the reversal entry with `include: { lines: true }`
- Uses same entry number generation pattern as `auto-journal.ts`

**2. Created journal entries reversal API route at `/src/app/api/journal-entries/[id]/reverse/route.ts`:**
- POST handler accepting `{ id }` param
- Wraps everything in `prisma.$transaction()`
- Calls `reverseEntry(id, tx)` within the transaction
- Returns the reversal entry on success
- Returns `{ error: message }` with status 400 on failure (Arabic error messages from engine)

**3. Updated client-payments API route (`/src/app/api/client-payments/[id]/route.ts`):**
- PATCH handler now supports reverse+recreate for POSTED payments:
  1. Reverses the original journal entry via `reverseEntry()`
  2. Unlinks `journalEntryId` from the payment
  3. Reverses the invoice `paidAmount` update if linked to a sales invoice
  4. Updates the payment with new data
  5. Creates a new journal entry via `createClientPaymentJournalEntry()`
  6. Applies the new invoice `paidAmount` update with the new amount
  7. Re-fetches the payment to include the new `journalEntryId`
  - All steps within a single `$transaction()`
- Non-posted payments (no `journalEntryId`) follow the simple update path (unchanged)
- DELETE handler remains unchanged (still blocks deletion of posted payments)

**4. Updated supplier-payments API route (`/src/app/api/supplier-payments/[id]/route.ts`):**
- PUT handler now supports reverse+recreate for POSTED payments:
  1. Reverses the original journal entry via `reverseEntry()`
  2. Unlinks `journalEntryId` from the payment
  3. Reverses the invoice `paidAmount` update if linked to a purchase invoice
  4. Updates the payment with new data
  5. Creates a new journal entry via `createSupplierPaymentJournalEntry()`
  6. Applies the new invoice `paidAmount` update with the new amount
  7. Re-fetches the payment to include the new `journalEntryId`
  - All steps within a single `$transaction()`
- Non-posted payments follow the simple update path (unchanged)
- DELETE handler remains unchanged (still blocks deletion of posted payments)

**5. Lint check:** Passes with 0 errors, 0 warnings
**6. Dev server:** Running normally on port 3000

Key design decisions:
- `reverseEntry()` REQUIRES a transaction client — cannot be called standalone, enforcing atomicity
- Original entry is CANCELLED (not deleted) — full audit trail preserved
- Reversal entry links back to original via `reversedEntryId` — bidirectional traceability
- Invoice paidAmount/status is properly reversed and re-applied in the same transaction
- Error messages are in Arabic for consistency with the rest of the application

Agent: Code Agent
Task: Update Dashboard API route to derive ALL financial numbers from the General Ledger (GL) instead of operational tables

Work Log:

**1. Replaced inline `getAccountBalance` with engine import:**
- Removed the inline `getAccountBalance` function (lines 4-25) that duplicated logic from the accounting engine
- Imported `getAccountBalance` from `@/lib/accounting/engine` — single source of truth
- Added new `getGLBalance()` helper function that aggregates GL balances by account type (REVENUE/EXPENSE/ASSET/LIABILITY) with optional filters for `activityType` and date range (`startDate`/`endDate`)
- The helper queries `JournalLine` directly with `account.type` and `account.allowPosting` filters, computing normal balance (CREDIT for revenue/liability, DEBIT for asset/expense)

**2. Replaced monthly revenue/expenses with GL-based queries:**
- Old: 7+ operational table queries per month (salesInvoice, progressClaim, expense, purchaseInvoice, salary, laborCost, equipmentUsage)
- New: 2 GL queries per month — `getGLBalance('REVENUE', { startDate, endDate })` and `getGLBalance('EXPENSE', { startDate, endDate })`
- Reduced ~42 queries across 6 months to 12 queries, with consistent GL-based accuracy

**3. Replaced total revenue/expenses with GL aggregates:**
- Old: `monthlyData.reduce()` — sum of last 6 months only (not truly "all time")
- New: `getGLBalance('REVENUE')` and `getGLBalance('EXPENSE')` — true all-time totals from posted journal entries

**4. Replaced activity-based metrics (construction/rental revenue/costs) with GL:**
- Old: ~12 operational table queries (progressClaim, salesInvoice, expense, purchaseInvoice, laborCost, equipmentCost, subcontractorInvoice, equipmentFuelLog — each for construction and rental)
- New: 4 GL queries using activityType filter:
  - `getGLBalance('REVENUE', { activityType: 'CONSTRUCTION' })` for constructionRevenue
  - `getGLBalance('REVENUE', { activityType: 'EQUIPMENT_RENTAL' })` for rentalRevenue
  - `getGLBalance('EXPENSE', { activityType: 'CONSTRUCTION' })` for constructionCosts
  - `getGLBalance('EXPENSE', { activityType: 'EQUIPMENT_RENTAL' })` for rentalCosts
- Activity type filtering uses `account.activityType IN (requestedType, 'BOTH')` to include shared accounts

**5. Replaced outstanding receivables/payables with GL account balances:**
- Old: Operational table queries on salesInvoice/purchaseInvoice with status filtering
- New: Sum of specific GL account balances:
  - Receivables: 1210 (Clients) + 1220 (Retention) + 1230 (Employee Advances) + 1240 (Supplier Advances) + 1250 (Other Receivables)
  - Payables: 3210 (Suppliers) + 3220 (Subcontractors) + 3310 (Salaries Payable) + 3320 (Other Accrued)
- Overdue amounts kept from operational tables since GL has no due-date concept

**6. Kept from operational tables (by design):**
- Project profitability detail (per task: "can remain from operational tables for project-level detail")
- Hub-specific outstanding construction/rental collections (project-specific detail; GL account 1210 can't be split by activity type)
- Overdue receivables/payables (GL lacks due-date tracking)
- All non-financial data (project counts, employee counts, equipment status, alerts, etc.)

**7. Response format preserved:**
- All response field names unchanged — no frontend breakage
- Same structure: KPIs, Activity-Based Metrics, Hub-specific Data, Charts & Tables

**8. Lint check:** Passes with 0 errors, 0 warnings

Summary of financial data sources after change:
- ✅ Cash position: GL (was already)
- ✅ VAT position: GL (was already)
- ✅ Total Revenue: GL (was salesInvoice + progressClaim)
- ✅ Total Expenses: GL (was expense + purchaseInvoice + salary + laborCost + equipmentUsage)
- ✅ Net Profit: GL (Revenue - Expenses)
- ✅ Construction Revenue/Costs: GL with activityType filter
- ✅ Rental Revenue/Costs: GL with activityType filter
- ✅ Outstanding Receivables: GL account balances (1210+1220+1230+1240+1250)
- ✅ Outstanding Payables: GL account balances (3210+3220+3310+3320)
- ✅ Monthly Revenue/Expenses: GL with date range filter
- ⚪ Overdue amounts: Operational tables (GL has no due dates)
- ⚪ Project profitability: Operational tables (project-level detail)

Task: Create two shared React components for Binaa ERP (AccountSelector & JePreview)

Work Log:
- Explored project structure: verified all shadcn/ui components available (select, card, badge, collapsible, table, skeleton, label, separator, money-display)
- Reviewed existing `accounting-entry-display.tsx` for design patterns and conventions (teal/emerald color scheme, MoneyDisplay usage, Arabic RTL layout, balanced/unbalanced badge pattern)
- Reviewed `/api/accounts/by-role` API route to understand query parameters (role, parentCode, activityType) and response shape
- Reviewed `account-roles.ts` for role constants and utility functions
- Created `AccountSelector` component (`/src/components/shared/account-selector.tsx`):
  - Uses TanStack Query `useQuery` to fetch accounts from `/api/accounts/by-role`
  - Supports both `roles` array (comma-separated) and `parentCode` filter modes
  - Supports optional `activityType` filter
  - Displays accounts as `${code} - ${nameAr || name}` in a shadcn/ui Select dropdown
  - Shows Skeleton loading state while fetching
  - Shows error message in Arabic on fetch failure
  - Shows "لا توجد حسابات" when no accounts found
  - Uses O(1) account lookup via Map for onValueChange callback
  - Full RTL support with `dir="rtl"`
  - `onValueChange` returns both the accountId and the full account object
- Created `JePreview` component (`/src/components/shared/je-preview.tsx`):
  - Shows a collapsible card with emerald accent border (consistent with existing accounting-entry-display)
  - Title with BookOpen icon, default "القيد المحاسبي المتوقع"
  - Table with columns: كود الحساب | اسم الحساب | مدين | دائن
  - Total row with total debit and credit using MoneyDisplay
  - Balanced/unbalanced badge (متوازن/غير متوازن) shown in header and totals footer
  - Uses MoneyDisplay component for all amounts with `showSymbol={false}` and `size="xs"`
  - Only renders when `visible` is true and `lines` has items
  - Full RTL support with `dir="rtl"`
  - Uses shadcn/ui Collapsible for expand/collapse behavior
- Ran lint check: no errors
- Dev server running normally

Stage Summary:
- Two production-ready shared components created
- Both follow existing project conventions (color scheme, MoneyDisplay usage, Arabic RTL)
- AccountSelector: reusable dropdown for account selection by role/parentCode
- JePreview: expected journal entry preview before saving (distinct from accounting-entry-display which shows saved JEs)

- Read `AccountSelector` and `JePreview` shared components to understand their API contracts
- Added imports for `AccountSelector` and `JePreview` (with `JePreviewLine` type)
- Added new form state fields: `payingAccountId`, `payingAccountCode`, `payingAccountName`, `expenseAccountId`, `expenseAccountCode`, `expenseAccountNameAr`, `activityType`
- Added `expenseParentCode` computed value based on `tab` + `activityType` (7100/7200 for project, 8100/8200 for admin)
- Added `jeLines` computed value for JE preview (Debit: expense account, Debit: VAT Input 1410, Credit: paying account)
- Replaced hardcoded `payFrom` Select with `AccountSelector` using `roles={['CASH', 'BANK']}`; maps back to payFrom enum for backward compatibility
- Replaced hardcoded `category` Select with activity-type selector + `AccountSelector` using `parentCode={expenseParentCode}`

- Updated tab toggle handlers to reset new fields on tab change
- Updated `useEffect` reset block to clear all new fields on dialog open
- Kept RTL layout throughout
- Lint check: passes with no errors

Stage Summary:
